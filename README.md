This repository is dedicated to the implementation of various time series forecasting models for predicting CO2 levels. It combines traditional statistical models with advanced neural networks, providing a comprehensive approach to forecasting. The project is structured to utilize React JS for the frontend, Flask for the backend, and SQLite3 for database management.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into two main parts: the frontend developed with React JS and the backend using Flask with SQLite3 for database operations. The models implemented include ARIMA, SARIMA, Simple Exponential Smoothing, ANN (Artificial Neural Networks), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), a hybrid neural network combining ANN with ARIMA residuals, and the Prophet model.
